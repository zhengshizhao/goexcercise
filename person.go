/*
1) Create a new type called person which is STRUCT that stores fName and lName

2)Using the STRUCT “person”,
using a composite literal create a value of type person
and assign it to a variable with the identifier “p1”;
print out “p1”; print out just the field fName for “p1”

3)Take the STRUCT “person” in the previous exercise and
add a field called “favFood” that stores a slice of string;
for the variable “p1” use a composite literal to add values to the field favFood;
print out the values in favFood; also print out the values for “favFood” by using a for range loop

4) Add a method to type “person” with the identifier “walk”.
Have the func return this string: <person’s first name> is walking.
Remember, you make a func a method by giving the func a receiver.
	func (r receiver) identifier(parameters) (returns) {
		<code>
	}
To return a string, use fmt.Sprintln.
Call the method assigning the returned string to a variable with the identifier “s”. Print out “s”.
