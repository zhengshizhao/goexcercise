/*Create a new type called “transportation”. 
The underlying type of this new type is interface. An interface defines functionality. 
Said another way, an interface defines behavior. 
For this interface, any other type that has a method with this signature …
	transportationDevice() string 
… will automatically, implicitly implement this interface. 
Create a func called “report” that takes a value of type “transportation” as an argument. 
The func should print the string returned by “transportationDevice()” being called for any type 
that implements the “transportation” interface. 
Call “report” passing in a value of type truck. 
Call “report” passing in a value of type sedan.*/
