/* create another type called “flamingo”.
Make the underlying type of “flamingo” bool. Give “flamingo” a method with this signature …
	greeting()
… and have it print “Hello, I am pink and beautiful and wonderful.”
Now create a new type “swampCreature”. The underlying type of “swapCreature” is interface.
The behavior which the “swampCreature” interface defines is such that any type which has this method …
	greeting()
… will implicitly implement the “swampCreature” interface.
Create a func called “bayou” which takes a value of type “swampCreature” as an argument.
Have this func print out the greeting for whatever “swampCreature” might be passed in.
